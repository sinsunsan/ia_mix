Theses mixins intend to abstract common elements needed to style a page

HOW TO USE IT ?
.................

1/ Moving at the command line to the directory, where you want to download IA MIX
We recommand to put it in the following way 

This folder would be the compass folder (the folder watched automaticaly by compass)
Drupalroot/sites/all/themes/youthemes/css/
Inside you'll have
config.rb : The file that set the compass configuration
css : the folder of the compiled css files
sass : the folder of the original sass files 
... other

Inside sass folder you'll have 
sass/ia_mix
sass/your_sass_files

ia_mix would compile in 
css/ia_mix/ia_mix.css
and your sass files in 
css/your_sass_files/your_sass_files.css

2/ Clone the git repositery by typing git clone git@github.com:sinsunsan/ia_mix.git in the chosen directory
3/ You have two options to use IA MIX 

  * Use only the mixins and styles provided by IA MIX 
  
  . You could use it on an existing theme, because of ia stuff being prepended with ia_ 
  . There few possibility that it can conflict with existing styles or mixin
  . @extend the IA styles or @import the is mixin into your classes
  
   How yo import IA MIX only : Type this line in you scss import file
   @import "path/to/ia_mix/ia_mix";
  

  
  * Use also the IA Drupal default theme 
  
  . Be careful with an existing theme as it will certainly change the apperance of your site
  . Depending of the specificity of your css IA THEME will win on your own style 
  . So it's better to use IA MIX THEME with a new site, and if you like our default styles
  
  How yo import IA MIX THEM : Type this line in you scss import file
  @import "path/to/ia_mix/ia_mix_theme";
  
4/ Insert in your drupal theme a line to include IA mix or IA theme css file (1 file) before your theme css files  
stylesheets[all][] = css/css/ia_mix/ia_mix_theme.css
